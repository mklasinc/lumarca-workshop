PROCESS ///////////////////////////////////
- Learn about your projector
- Figure out how many strings you need
- Mark where you need the strings to go
- Suspend the strings
- Calibrate the projection
- Run programs








LANGUAGE /////////////////////////////////

Projector
- Throw distance = projector distance
- Throw ratio = width of projection : projector distance
- Aspect ratio = width of projection : height of projection

Lumarca
- mapline = display width
- map unit = distance between strings on the x axis from bird’s eye view (mapline / number of strings)
- depth unit = distance between strings on the y axis from bird’s eye view
- depth = depth unit * depth levels








DIMENSIONS /////////////////////////////////

1 CHOOSE WIDTH (MAPLINE)
Only as wide as the width of the foam core (=padding)
Pick a number that makes marking map units easy. In other words, pick a number that, when divided by the number of strings used, outputs a neat number, such that you can easily measure and mark repeatedly

2 CALCULATE DISPLAY DEPTH
Only as wide as the width of the foam core
Based on the number of depth levels determined by the wiremap instructable 

3 CALCULATE DISPLAY HEIGHT
Equation
mapline : x = aspect ratio
